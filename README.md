## Development

Example .env file:

```
# This declares an environment variable named "DISCORD_TOKEN" with the given
# value. When calling `kankyo::load()`, it will read the `.env` file and parse
# these key-value pairs and insert them into the environment.

# Environment variables are separated by newlines and must not have space
# around the equals sign (`=`).
DISCORD_TOKEN=Nzk3OTMxNzIzOTA3MjY4Njk4.X_tp0w.etHvgPQ1m7C0ixNGAXZtZb2rj80

# Declares the level of logging to use. Read the documentation for the `log`
# and `env_logger` crates for more information.
RUST_LOG=debug
```
